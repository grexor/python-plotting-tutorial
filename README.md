### About matplotlib

The project was initiated by John D. Hunter in 2008. The initial introductory text stated:

<p align="justify">"Matplotlib is a library for making 2D plots of arrays in Python. Although it has its origins in emulating the MATLAB graphics commands, it is independent of MATLAB, and can be used in a Pythonic, object oriented way. Although Matplotlib is written primarily in pure Python, it makes heavy use of NumPy and other extension code to provide good performance even for large arrays."</p>

To keep in mind: "**Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible**". The matplotlib "easy" part is named **pyplot** module and provides a MATLAB-like interface.
